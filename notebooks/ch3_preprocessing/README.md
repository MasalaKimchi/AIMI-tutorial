# Chapter 3: Medical Image Preprocessing for AI

This notebook explores essential preprocessing steps that prepare imaging data for machine‑learning models:

- **Intensity normalization** techniques, including z‑score and percentile‑based scaling.
- **Noise reduction** with Gaussian smoothing, median filters and non‑local means denoising.
- **Contrast enhancement** via histogram equalization, CLAHE and sigmoid adjustments.
- Discussion of best practices and quantitative metrics for evaluating preprocessing choices.

These methods help ensure images are consistent and informative before they are fed into AI pipelines.
