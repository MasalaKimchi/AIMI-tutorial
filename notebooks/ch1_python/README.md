# Chapter 1: Introduction to Python for Medical Imaging

This chapter serves as a refresher on fundamental Python tools used throughout the tutorial. The accompanying notebook covers:

- **NumPy basics** – creating arrays, performing element-wise operations and manipulating multi-dimensional data.
- **Matplotlib visualizations** – plotting data, displaying images and exploring medical‑specific colormaps.
- Generating a simulated "brain" image to demonstrate array operations and visualization techniques.
- A brief look at 3‑D plotting to illustrate how volumetric data can be displayed.

By the end you will be comfortable handling numerical data and creating clear plots – skills that will be used in subsequent chapters when working with real medical images.
