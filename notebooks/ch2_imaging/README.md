# Chapter 2: Understanding Medical Images â€“ Formats & Visualization

The second chapter introduces common medical image formats and demonstrates how to load and inspect them. Key topics include:

- Overview of the DICOM standard and associated metadata.
- Loading DICOM files and examining patient and acquisition information.
- Visualizing images with appropriate windowing and colormap choices.
- Displaying multiple slices from a series and discussing basic processing steps.

The notebook relies on the example-dicom-structural dataset and provides exercises to practice exploring metadata and experimenting with visualization parameters.
